# This structure will hekp to avoid naming conflics.
# Since we can have multiple components in out project, each with their own templates,
# by having subfolder for each component, we can easily identify each of them. 

# Also, Django template loader will be looking for templates in specific directories. 
# By following the convention provided and placing component-specific templates in their respective compoment's folders, 
# it is ensured that Django can easily find and render the templates.
